# WACE Apache Module

The general objective of this project is to build machine
learning-assisted web application firewall mechanisms for the
identification, analysis and prevention of computer attacks on web
applications. The main idea is to combine the flexibility provided by
the classification procedures obtained from machine learning models
with the codified knowledge integrated in the specification of the
[OWASP Core Rule Set](https://coreruleset.org/) used by the [ModSecurity WAF](https://www.modsecurity.org/) to detect attacks, while
reducing false positives. The next figure shows a high-level
overview of the architecture:

This repository contains the Apache module that connects ModSecurity
to the WACE backend. 

Please see the [WACE core
repo](https://github.com/tilsor/ModSecIntl_wace_core) and the [machine
learning model
repo](https://github.com/tilsor/ModSecIntl_roberta_model) for the rest
of the components.

You can find more information about the project, including published
research articles, at the [WAF Mind
site](https://www.fing.edu.uy/inco/proyectos/wafmind)
